# Creating a landing zone with the ASVM

Let's say a team would like to set up Infrastructure as Code for their new project or application. We will need to create a landing zone - a subscription with a set of baseline resources (like virtual networks or key vaults), where they can begin to deploy the infrastructure to host their applications (like Web Apps or Virtual Machines).

1 - Clone one of the project folders and its contents

2 - Adjust the name and the keys in the file as needed

3 - Update the address space of the `virtual_network` configuration.

4 - Update the tfstates.yaml

5 - run rover ignite for the platform (it creates a storage container in the level3 and level4 storage accounts - this step will be removed in future releases)

6 - run rover ignite for the asvm

7 - Re-execute the launchpad level0 (to create the storage containers)

8 - Execute the command from the subscription readme

9 - Execute the command from the resources readme

10 - Execute the command from the connectivity readme

11 - Execute the command from the solution accelerator readme (not available yet - in future releases)


As you scale out, your team would eventually need to build some automation or DevOps pipelines to automate the above process, based on a set of parameters passed in (a true vending machine).
